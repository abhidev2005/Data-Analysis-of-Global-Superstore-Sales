# Data-Analysis-of-Global-Superstore-Sales
This project involved analyzing sales data from a global superstore to uncover insights related to revenue trends, customer demographics, and product performance. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we processed and visualized large datasets to identify key sales patterns, seasonal trends, and regional performance variations. Additionally, we performed statistical analysis to evaluate profit margins, shipping costs, and customer purchasing behavior. The insights derived helped in making data-driven decisions to optimize inventory management and marketing strategies
